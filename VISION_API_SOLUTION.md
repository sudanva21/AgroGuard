# Vision API Solution - Options

## Current Status
Vision models keep getting decommissioned. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use llava Model (Testing Now)
- Model: `llava-v1.5-7b-4096-preview`
- Status: Should work (stable Groq model)
- Try refreshing browser and test

## Option 2: Use OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (Paid but Reliable)
If you want guaranteed working vision analysis:

1. Get OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to .env: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
3. Model: `gpt-4-vision-preview` or `gpt-4o`
4. Cost: ~$0.01 per image analysis

## Option 3: Intelligent Text-Based (No Vision Needed)
Remove image upload, use enhanced symptom questions:
- More detailed symptom dropdowns
- Photo description text input
- Color pickers for symptoms
- Still very accurate

## Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Best User Experience)
1. User uploads image
2. App shows image preview
3. User describes what they see (guided questions)
4. AI analyzes description + crop type
5. Very accurate without vision API

## Recommendation
Let me know which option you prefer:
1. Test llava model (refresh browser now)
2. Use OpenAI Vision (paid but reliable)
3. Enhanced symptom-only approach (free, no vision)
4. Hybrid user-description approach (best UX)
