# ✅ Documentation Organized Successfully!

## 📁 What I Did

Organized **all markdown documentation files** into a clean structure:

---

## 🎯 Root Directory (Clean & Presentation-Ready)

**Files Remaining in Root:**
```
✅ AGROGUARD_AI_PRESENTATION.md     (Main presentation - 25-30 slides)
✅ QUICK_PITCH_DECK.md              (5-minute pitch)
✅ PROJECT_SHOWCASE.md              (Technical docs)
✅ PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md            (How-to use presentations)
✅ PRESENTATION_FILES_SUMMARY.md    (Overview guide)
✅ README.md                        (Project README)
```

**These 6 files** are the most important for judges and presentations!
