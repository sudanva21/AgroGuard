   - Added conversation history support for context-aware responses
   - Built-in error handling and rate limit management

2. **Updated Chatbot Component** (`src/pages/Chatbot.jsx`)
   - Removed hard-coded responses
   - Integrated real AI service
   - Added proper error handling
   - Maintains conversation context for better responses

## üöÄ How It Works

### AI Capabilities
Your assistant now provides:
- **Real-time agricultural advice** from Llama 3.3 70B model
- **Context-aware responses** - remembers conversation history
- **Expert knowledge** on:
  - Crop diseases and pest management
  - Fertilizer recommendations (NPK ratios)

- Concise, clear responses (2-4 sentences)

## üîß Configuration

### API Key (Already Configured)
Your `.env` file already has the Groq API key:
```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=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
```

### Model Used
- **Model:** `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- **Temperature:** 0.7 (balanced creativity)
- **Max Tokens:** 500 (reasonable response length)
- **Stream:** Disabled (instant full responses)

## üìù Testing Your Assistant

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Questions
Try asking your assistant:

**Disease Identification:**
- "How do I identify tomato blight?"
- "What are symptoms of rice blast disease?"
- "My wheat leaves are turning yellow, what's wrong?"

**Fertilizer Advice:**
- "What fertilizer should I use for rice?"
- "When should I apply NPK to my corn field?"
- "How much urea per hectare for sugarcane?"

**Pest Management:**
- "How to control aphids organically?"
- "Best time to spray pesticides?"
- "Natural pest control for tomatoes?"

**Government Schemes:**
- "Tell me about PM-KISAN scheme"
- "How to get crop insurance?"
- "What is Soil Health Card?"

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Real, intelligent responses from AI
- ‚úÖ Context-aware (remembers conversation)
- ‚úÖ Agricultural expertise specific to India
- ‚úÖ Practical, actionable advice
- ‚úÖ Error handling if API fails

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

### Check Console Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console:
- You should see API calls being made to Groq
- No errors about "hard-coded responses"

### Response Quality
Real AI responses will:
- Be more detailed and contextual
- Vary each time you ask the same question
- Reference specific agricultural practices
- Show understanding of Indian farming context

### Conversation Context
The AI remembers previous messages:
1. Ask: "What's the best fertilizer for rice?"
2. AI responds with specific recommendation
3. Follow up: "When should I apply it?"
4. AI remembers you're talking about rice fertilizer

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "AI service is not properly configured"
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` set

### Issue: "Too many requests"
**Solution:** Groq has rate limits. Wait a few seconds between requests

### Issue: "I'm having trouble connecting"
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection
- Verify Groq API key is valid
- Check browser console for detailed error
