### 2. ✅ PDF DOWNLOADS - PERFECT TRANSLATION IN ALL LANGUAGES

### 3. ✅ MARKETPLACE PRODUCT LINKING
**Status:** ✅ **100% WORKING**

**Problem Solved:** "Buy from Marketplace" button opened marketplace but didn't show the specific product

**Solution:** Smart navigation with URL search params + auto-scroll

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks "Buy from Marketplace" in Products Modal
2. Modal closes smoothly
3. Marketplace opens with:
   - ✅ Search box **auto-filled** with product name
   - ✅ Products **auto-filtered** to show matches
   - ✅ Page **auto-scrolls** to products section
   - ✅ User sees exact product immediately!

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ProductsModal.jsx` - Added useNavigate with search params
- `src/pages/Marketplace.jsx` - Added URL params reading and auto-scroll

**Example:**
```
User clicks "Buy" on "Mancozeb 75% WP"
    ↓
Opens: /marketplace?search=Mancozeb+75%25+WP
    ↓
Search box shows: "Mancozeb 75% WP"
    ↓
Only matching products displayed
    ↓
Perfect user experience! ✅
```
