# ✅ Admin Access - FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Admin dashboard kept redirecting to login even when logged in

**Solution:** Now waits for authentication to fully load before checking

---

## 🧪 Test It Now

### Step 1: Add Your Email to Admin List

Run in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (email, created_by)
VALUES ('sudanva@gmail.com', 'system')
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 2: Login to Website

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with your account

### Step 3: Access Admin Dashboard

Type this URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard-2025
```

**It should work now!** No more redirect loop! ✅

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it works when:
- ✅ No redirect to login
- ✅ Brief loading spinner
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ See "Logged in as: sudanva@gmail.com"
- ✅ Can add products

## 🔍 Still Not Working?

Check these:

**1. Are you logged in?**
- Look at website header
- Should see your name

**2. Is email in admin_users?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_users WHERE email = 'sudanva@gmail.com';
```

**3. Did you run the schema?**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'admin_users';
```

## 🎉 What Changed

**Before (Broken):**
- Dashboard checked for user immediately
- User was still loading
- Thought you weren't logged in
- Redirected to login
- Loop!

**After (Fixed):**
- Dashboard waits for auth to finish loading
- Then checks if user exists
- Only redirects if truly not logged in
- Works perfectly!
