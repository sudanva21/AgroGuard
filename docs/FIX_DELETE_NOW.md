# 🔧 Fix Admin Deletion - Do This NOW

## 🎯 Two-Step Fix

### Step 1: Fix Database Policy (2 minutes)

**Open Supabase SQL Editor and run this:**

```sql
-- Fix the delete policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can remove admins" ON admin_users;

CREATE POLICY "Admins can remove admins"
  ON admin_users
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM admin_users 
      WHERE email = auth.jwt()->>'email'
    )
  );

-- Grant delete permission
GRANT DELETE ON admin_users TO authenticated;
```

Click **RUN** ✅

### Step 2: Test Deletion (1 minute)

1. **Refresh your browser** (CTRL + F5)
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Console
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Go to admin dashboard** → Administrators tab
5. **Click trash icon** on `admin@test.com`
6. **Confirm deletion**
7. **Look at console** - you'll see detailed logs:
   ```
   🗑️ Delete Admin Called: {...}
   ✅ Confirmation result: true
   🚀 Attempting to delete admin from Supabase...
   📊 Supabase Response: {...}
   ✅ Admin deleted successfully!
   ```

## 🔍 What to Check

### If you see an ERROR in console:

**Screenshot the console and tell me:**
1. What's the error message?
2. What's the error code?

### If you see SUCCESS in console:

- ✅ Admin should be removed from list
- ✅ Go to Supabase → admin_users table
- ✅ Verify the admin is deleted there too

---

## 🚨 Quick Test

**Add a test admin and delete it:**

```sql
-- Add test admin
INSERT INTO admin_users (email, created_by)
VALUES ('test-delete-me@test.com', 'sudanva@gmail.com');
```

Now go delete it from dashboard and check if it works!
