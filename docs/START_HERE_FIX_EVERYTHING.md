## 🔧 ADMIN DASHBOARD - Multi-Image Support

Currently, admin can add ONE image URL. To add multiple images:

**Temporary Solution:**
When adding product in admin panel, enter image URLs separated by comma:
```
https://image1.com/photo.jpg,https://image2.com/photo.jpg,https://image3.com/photo.jpg
```

I can update the admin panel to have multiple image inputs if you want!
