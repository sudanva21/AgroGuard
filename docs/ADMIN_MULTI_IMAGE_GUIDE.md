## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to provide all 3 images?**
A: No! Only Image 1 is required. Image 2 and 3 are optional.

**Q: Can I add more than 3 images?**
A: Currently limited to 3 images. This is optimal for page load speed.

**Q: What if I only add 1 image?**
A: That's fine! The detail page will just show that one image without thumbnails.

**Q: Can I use the same image multiple times?**
A: Yes, but it's better to use different angles/views of the product.

**Q: Do old products without multiple images still work?**
A: Yes! They'll automatically use their single image. You can edit them to add more images.
